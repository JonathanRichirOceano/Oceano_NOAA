# Boucle à créer pour calculer le Degree Heat Week (accumulation d anomalies de températures positives)
# Info sur le DHW : Mass coral bleaching has been shown to be caused by prolonged periods of thermal stress. The DHW product accumulates # any HotSpots greater than 1 °C over a 12- week window, thus showing how stressful conditions have been for corals in the last three 
# months. It is a cumulative measurement of the intensity and duration of thermal stress, and is expressed in the unit °C-weeks.
